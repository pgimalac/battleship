## Project description
This project is a battleship game aimed at making me learn and pratice Rust.

#### Details
For the time being there is no text so it isn't very handy.

There is a main menu from which you can chose what to do : network multiplayer, AI multiplayer or quit.

If you choose to play, both ways eventually bring you to a game creation panel from which you can position your boats. Any unpositionned boat is placed randomly.

You end up on the game panel where you see on the left side your boats and on the right side your attacks on the opponent.

#### Controls
At any time :
- *escape* ends the process
- *q* brings back to the menu

During the game creation :
- *r* rotate the selected boat
- *left click down* select a boat
- *left click up* drop the selected boat
- *right click up* rotate the selected boat
